In this lab, I learned how to use Git and GitHub. 
I became familiar with important terms related to version control systems and how they may be useful. 
I practiced cloning a repository and working with files locally.
I also learned how to use Git commands to track and push changes.
This assignment helped me understand the basics of version control and project's structure.
